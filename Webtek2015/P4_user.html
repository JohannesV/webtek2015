					<h3><a name="adm">Administrative Details</a></h3>
					<p>
						We have still not heard back from the client we contacted, so we will continue using a fictive one. Therefore we do not have a client and website name or contact person and will continue with dummy pictures and text.
						<br />
						<br />
						Client name: Lorem Ipsum
						<br />
						<br />
						Website name: Dolor
						<br />
						<br />
						Contact person: Sit Amet

					<h3><a name="tas">Tasks</a></h3>
					<p>
						<b>Booking:</b><i> Book an appointment with Petter Fuglevikke when he is available on December 12th.</i>
						</br></br>This task was given in order for us to check if the booking page seems intuitive and easy to use. The main part of the hair salon web page is to be able to book appointments and to make booking easier both for our client and for the customer. </br>
						</br><b>Price List:</b><i> Check how much it costs to bleach your roots.</i>
						</br></br>The task is about navigation and content undersanding. We wanted to check the use of the navigation bar and how well we managed to convey the information. The price list page contains a lot of information, and we want to check whether the customers is okay with the information load on this particular page.</br>
						</br><b>Location:</b><i> Check where the hairdresser is located.</i>
						</br></br>Again to check the navigation bar, to see if the placement of the information is intuitive and to check whether the customer is satisfied with the information given.</br>

					<h3><a name="td">Testing Document</a></h3>

					<p>
						<strong>Google Form</strong>:
						<ul>

							<li>
								<p>
									The google form that was sent out contains three sections. The first section asks the user for general information. This contains gender and age to be sure that the usability test has been aimed at our target audience. The rest of the general information section asks for the platform being used and browser information.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The second section in the form is the task section. In this section the questions are directed towards the tasks that the users were asked to complete before answering thie form. These are questions giving us insight as to whether the users find the web page easy to navigate, easy to read, if they like the layout or not and if they encountered any challenges in completing the tasks.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									For the last section, the comment section, we wanted some general comments from the users regarding the web page. We gave some open questions asking for things the user would have wanted from a hair salon web page that we have not thought about, and also regarding the aesthetics and general content. 
								</p>

					<h3><a name="ta">Testing Audience:</a></h3>
					<p>
					In order to receive useful feedback for our project, each group member shared a link with five or more friends and family members both via email and Facebook. Each of us tried to locate those who might be the most interested in actually using such a web page, hence mostly adult women in the age group 20-55. This allowed us to get a reasonable sized audience. Due to restricted time we could not perform website tests live, so we had to rely single handedly on the form replies. 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3><a name="fs">Feedback Summary:</a></h3>
					<p>
					In total we got 28 responses. Out of these 28, 24 were women, and we saw that the majority of the testers were in the age group 18-34 years. Almost half were using a Mac, whilst 18% were using a smartphone. We registered that some of the optional text feedback related to the smartphone users said that the buttons were a bit too small, and that this made the tasks more difficult to perform. </br></br>
					Chrome and Firefox were the most used browsers with 35,7% of the testers each. Safari had 25%, and only 3,6% (one tester) used Internet Explorer.</br></br>
					57,1% of the testers strongly agreed that the tasks we gave them were easy to perform - this tells us that we have succeeded in fulfilling our goal of an intuitive web page. 39,3% of the testers had chosen “agree” on this statement.</br></br> 
					</p>
					<figure style="display: inline-block;">
						<img src="../img/survey/Screenshot3.png"  style="width:100%; display:block ;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						<figcaption id="figcapScreenshot3">Navigation between pages.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
					Also, 71,4% strongly agreed that the page allowed for easy navigating between pages. Here we also found 3 testers on the opposite side of the scale, but we suspect that this might be due to interchangeable scales. In an attempt to stimulate the tester we chose to have this statement scale opposite of the others. This might be a catch when it comes to testers who automatically assume that the scales are similar during the whole form. </br></br>
					</p>
					<figure style="display: inline-block;">
						<img src="../img/survey/Screenshot4.png"  style="width:100%; display:block ;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						<figcaption id="figcapScreenshot4">Aesthetics.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
					To our satisfaction, all of our testers said that they found our page to be aesthetically pleasing. This has been important to us from day one when working on this project, and tells us that we have done something right. </br></br>
					</p>
					<figure style="display: inline-block;">
						<img src="../img/survey/Screenshot1.png"  style="width:100%; display:block ;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						<figcaption id="figcapScreenshot1">85.7% said the content was easy to read.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
					85,7% of our testers said that the content on each page was easy to read. We suspect that the remaining testers were those on a smartphone - for as we have seen ourselves, the page is not optimal for such a small screen, especially not the booking part. Should we have worked further on this project, we would have focused more on adapting the page to smaller screens. </br></br>
					</p>
					<figure style="display: inline-block;">
						<img src="../img/survey/Screenshot2.png"  style="width:100%; display:block ;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						<figcaption id="figcapScreenshot2">89.3% said the overall loading time was good.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
					A whole 89,3% of the testers said that the loading time was quick - also satisfying the main goal we had made at the beginning of this project.

					<h3><a name="selfr">Self-Reflection</a></h3>
					<p>
					During this project it has been fun to see how quickly the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can turn into an almost fully functionable web page. From making a quick mockup in inDesign to actually see it visualized on screen as a product of our coding is quite a satisying feeling. 
					</br></br>
					Working as a team has been mostly positive: Being an interdisciplinary group, we have had the advantage of structuring the work according to each member’s strength and competence - hence making the process more effective. In addition to this, we have also learned a great lot from each other. The downside to it is finding time to work toghether - it is quite difficult when most of us have different schedules.
